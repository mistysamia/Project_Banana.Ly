            An enhanced url-shortener webpage, build with <3 as a group project for our university course (Software Development - IV)
            Perhaps we're going to improve it later gethering more knowledges. In simple words- we take your long-ugly urls and shrink it
            to small links and offer you a good protion of the income we earn from the ads we show during the redirection.

                    A multi-identity person. Sometimes she is jungle queen (monkey), sometimes she is CSS queen
                    but she always holds her real identity that is - 'an impostor'.

                    FYI: I wrote this about page and IG you've got some idea about me after reading other two persons' info :3
                    TBH: Whatever you're thinking - is wrong :( That's a good paradox, isn't it?<br>
                    I love problem solving (I meant programming problems, not social/personal problems).

                    He looks like a good guy <strike>but he is another impostor</strike> and he really is.
                    He made '24x7 studying' myth true.
